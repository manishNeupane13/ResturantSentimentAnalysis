More so my sister from the US, visiting with us fell at the restroom entrance due to water there. We had hard time raising the manager, Mr Kumar, who struttted in like a peacock, without offering any solid solution.
They encourage / employ differently abled people and have some old timers still working. Also ( we're vegetarians and are always skeptical about ) the food was good. This makes it worth average rating.

We went there next day again and opted for Thai dishes. Though the taste was not as good as Bangkok, it was good enough for me. They don't put fish oil in their preparation but you can ask for fish sauce and add to your dish. They don't have sticky white rice.

Rajamirchi is the third hottest chilly in the world and I would suggest...to keep it medium spicy and some water. But the taste lingers on for sometime after. Their sticky rice (local red/brown rice) is a great accompaniment. 
The service is great, waiters are polite, and the decor is Naga style and perfect setting for the food.

The owner was there the night I went with a Nepali friend who recommended.  I ate what she recommended.  The dark brown sauce was made with fermented sweet potato leaf and spices.  It was absolutely delicious, the best single dish I had in Kathmandu.  (and foodies know that Kathmandu has an abundance of international restaurants that serve wonderful food.)  To combat the spiciness the owner recommended steamed zucchini (she called it pumpkin) and the rice dish we had was amazing.  Wish I had written down the name.  The rice that accompanied the meal was dark brown and that wasn't whole grain.  Overall, an amazing culinary experience, a great mixture of mild vs. spicy, simple vs. complex.

It was awesome. We were fortunate enough to...go when the owner and head chef, Karen, was visiting from India (there is another Dzukou branch in Delhi). Karen walked us through the menu, resulting in one of the best meals I've ever had in Kathmandu. The food, mainly pork, is from her home area of Nagaland, and each dish was very distinctive - and delicious. Initially we were intimidated by the Naga Viper, the world's 3rd hottest pepper, but Karen had the kitchen make a few versions of varying spiciness, and we worked up to trying the actual pepper, which was fantastic. Dzukou is the kind of off-the-beaten path place that the late Anthony Bourdain would have stumbled upon and loved. A great choice for one of the more memorable meals in Kathmandu.

"BIG BELLY RESTAURANT, Kathmandu - Restaurant Reviews, Photos & Phone Number - Tripadvisor","Nepali, Bar, Cafe","Reviewed July 23, 2019 ",A dining experience to remember,"I recently visited Thamel, Nepal and was walking down the streets browsing through local shops and restaurants in search of authentic Nepali culture and cuisine which is where I discovered this hidden gem called 'Big Belly Restaurant’. As I entered the restaurant, I was welcomed...with great warmth, was seated on the patio and was handed one of the most elaborate menus consisting of cuisines representing various parts of the world and of course, authentic Nepali cuisine. 

While I was browsing through the menu, I was greeted by a young gentleman named Sulab Giri who began recommending must-have dishes from the menu and began talking about the authenticity and simplicity of the cuisine with a lot of pride. The food was served in traditional brassware and it did not take long for the me to be engulfed with the most pleasant aroma. I just couldn't wait to dig in! As I started tasting every preparation served before me, I couldn't help but appreciate the simplicity of the food with surprising complexities in flavors using the simplest of organic ingredients and the easiest cooking methods. 

Very eager to know how the food was prepared, I requested Sulab Giri for a tour of the kitchen and he simply offered me the opportunity to spend an evening to learn their techniques and methods. I went back that evening with my imaginary chef whites on, to learn authentic Thakali and Newari cuisines which constitute part of Nepali cuisine. Sulab Giri took me through their techniques of making the Nepali Thali, the most sought after ‘momos’ and delicious choyla. 

This whole experience for me as a chef was not only fun but truly enriching. I later discovered that Sulab Giri was the brother of the owner of the restaurant, Khushal Giri. 

I highly recommend this place for a one-of-a-kind culinary experience which I will cherish for years to come.More",5

1st the positive: the resturant has a great feel in a good rooftop location- call for drinks and you will be fine.

2nd the food:...we ordered 3 meals being mutton biryani which was just peppery and had some meat but also big lumps of fat. Not plesant and i left most of the dish. My wife had Chicken Carbonara and i can only describe the appearance as that of a plate of noodle and cat food, needless to say my wife left the dish. Worst, our friend who simply chooses not to eat dishes including bone on meat ordered the boneless chicken curry. This turned out to be meat on the bone and not as per the menu description.

3rd: the service, when our friend complained that the meal served was not as ordered the staff smirked and walked off. We called another member of staff who apologised while smirking and ignored the complaint. After my interjection we finally got a weak apology and the item removed from the bill but personally we had gone out to enjoy a nice meal and this was totally ruined. I have not wrote a bad review previously and this is honest feedback. My advice is enjoy a drink here but move on if you want good food and service.More",1

Because it’s the tourist season and Bhaitak is a Nepali singing, dancing show of a touristy...place, my wife made reservations well in advance.  When the day rolled around, we arrived at Bhaitak’s upstairs location at 7:30 PM on the dot, the time of our reservation.

Immediately, we were confronted with a whirl of confusion and discombobulation.  There was a large group of 15-20 Nepali government functionaries celebrating what appeared to be a retirement at one long table and several other smaller groups in the main hall, but the restaurant was not full.  We repeatedly tried to get the attention of one of the staff members swirling around the establishment, but no one heeded our calls.  Finally, finally after 10 minutes we were able to tell one of the staff we had a reservation for 7:30.  He immediately disappeared.  Only when we got the attention of a gentleman who appeared to be a manager were we finally seated.  A young lady in local costume immediately applied a tikka to our foreheads.  Things were looking up – not.

A waiter showed up with menus and seemed astonished when we ordered the “delux” meal (There are only 2 set meals on the menu!)  We also ordered soda water and commenced to waiting.  5 minutes passed, 10, 15 – we waived down the manager again.  “Excuse me, we ordered dinner and two plain sodas 15 minutes ago…”  5 more minutes passed and the soda arrived.  We had now been in the restaurant for 30 minutes and we weren’t even sure our order had been taken.  Several small groups of tourists around us appeared restless.  They had various parts of the set meal, but the restaurant’s ability to complete the task seemed to have entirely broken down.  5 more minutes passed – 35 minutes from our 7:30 PM reservation.  Things were clearly not getting better.  We placed a NPR 100 bill on the table to cover the soda and left.  We walked past waiters and the manager.  No one even asked us why…More",1

"EVEREST STEAK HOUSE RESTAURANT, Kathmandu - Restaurant Reviews, Photos & Phone Number - Tripadvisor",Steakhouse,"Reviewed December 31, 2017 ",Don't order fish,"This place is a little outside Thamel. A local friend took me here, and not thinking it through, I ordered a fish steak, despite verifying that all the fish they got were frozen ones, not fresh catch. It was...weird. Had a strong salty taste to...it, and too obviously not fresh, which the server explained away by saying ""it's frozen marine fish"". He probably had no idea that marine white fish should have very little salt in it. 

That said, the service was attentive, probably also because we were the only customers around. Looking at other reviews, probably chicken or other types of meat that can be freshly procured locally would be a better bet.More",3

I would say that the price is fair, although it is a little bit higher than the majority of the places. It is also a little bit outside of the touristic area, but it was interesting walking by ourselves outside of Thamel (the more turistic neighbourhood where most of the hotels are located). The staff was very friendly and caring.More",5

We had butter chicken in red curry and a vegetarian yellow curry dishes, which mixed with white rice dish was what I wanted. Paired with an Everest beer and then some tea, we quite enjoyed our meal 

The service was superb, with a couple of servers per table and attention to detail that you would expect on a high end British restaurant (I say this as our Nepali servers’ accent was British). 

From there, we went back to the high speed and multiple street noises heading to Pathel market.More",4

They have a very diverse menu from different parts of the world. I tried the biryani and I have to say that it was incredible. Not spicy but full of...exotic flavors. My friend order pasta carbonara and she loved it as well. The service is excellent.
It looks like they are remodeling the area so not sure what it would look like after they are done, I did notice that they try to keep it very clean. The decor is ok, definitely not a fancy place and the prices are decent for this area. There is an outdoor patio that is brand new, and two other bars. 
In the evenings this place turns into lounge and the place looks very different, seems to be very popular. I personally enjoyed the quiet lunch hour and the breeze from the open windows. I felt like I had the whole place to myself. Definitely will be going back to try more items on the menu.More",4

"FUSION KITCHEN RESTAURANT, Kathmandu - Restaurant Reviews, Photos & Phone Number - Tripadvisor","Vegetarian Friendly, Vegan Options, Gluten Free Options","Reviewed September 2, 2019 ",A wonderful place to eat and relax!,"A wonderful place.

First Location: It is sort of hidden gem as it is in a little alley tucked away from the busy shopping streets of Thamel. So you will find it a cool and quiet place to sit, relax and eat.

I am myself...a tour operator in Kathmandu and have eaten here myself many times. Those are times eating by myself or bringing my group of clients.

The restaurant is not very big and is very well decorated with cool lights for the evenings. The upstairs has a hall and a small patio outside. I especially love the patio. The restaurant has used a good portion of its indoors with flower pots creating greenery.

The staff are very friendly and listen to all of your requests. If you request they are happy to give you some discount on the price. If you have a group, then go and make a reservation, they will set and prep food exactly you like. The staff is happy to sit with you and work it out.

The food quality is very good. I loved the food and many items available on the menu. They listen to your custom choices as in how much spicy you want or what you do not want if you're have some dietary requirements. The food is not priced very high and its definitely worth the restaurant's ambiance and quality it offers.

In addition, I have seen many tourists visit here with requests to watch their country's sports on their TV. The restaurant has a big TV for customers to watch and can even provide you with an HDMI cable to extend one's computer screen to the TV. A big extra I commend this business for.

Lastly, the staff does not mind if you want to just chill and work with your computer here. I enjoy a lot of my time here while working on my computer. Visit here and you'll definitely become a friend.

First Location: It is sort of hidden gem as it is in a little alley tucked away from the busy shopping streets of Thamel. So you will find it a cool and quiet place to sit, relax and eat.

I am myself...a tour operator in Kathmandu and have eaten here myself many times. Those are times eating by myself or bringing my group of clients.

The restaurant is not very big and is very well decorated with cool lights for the evenings. The upstairs has a hall and a small patio outside. I especially love the patio. The restaurant has used a good portion of its indoors with flower pots creating greenery.

The staff are very friendly and listen to all of your requests. If you request they are happy to give you some discount on the price. If you have a group, then go and make a reservation, they will set and prep food exactly you like. The staff is happy to sit with you and work it out.

The food quality is very good. I loved the food and many items available on the menu. They listen to your custom choices as in how much spicy you want or what you do not want if you're have some dietary requirements. The food is not priced very high and its definitely worth the restaurant's ambiance and quality it offers.

In addition, I have seen many tourists visit here with requests to watch their country's sports on their TV. The restaurant has a big TV for customers to watch and can even provide you with an HDMI cable to extend one's computer screen to the TV. A big extra I commend this business for.

Lastly, the staff does not mind if you want to just chill and work with your computer here. I enjoy a lot of my time here while working on my computer. Visit here and you'll definitely become a friend.

"BRIAN'S GRILL HOUSE, Kathmandu - Restaurant Reviews, Photos & Phone Number - Tripadvisor","Mexican, American, Bar, Barbecue, Pub","Reviewed July 7, 2014 ","Absolute disappointment, Overpriced drinks, Average food, but Great view","I come from a foodie family.  We recently moved to Kathmandu and we specifically sought this restaurant out for 2 reasons: they used to host swing dance nights and we heard about the decent food.  Before arrival, it was a little difficult to find because...there are absolutely no signs, not even inside the building. That was fine but it is in a really dirty part of the city; not pleasant.

The staff were welcoming on arrival.  The only positive thing I have to say is that the view is REALLY extraordinary; virtually a 180 view (and more) of Kathmandu and the Himalayas. 

I was initially shocked at the alcohol prices (beer was reasonable given the real estate) however paying US$12 for a margarita is really crazy in Kathmandu given the run down atmosphere of the restaurant.  Secondly, the first four things we ordered were not in stock (two beers, chipotle burger & something else I have forgotten)--I have never understood this about restaurants.   I opted for a different burger instead and the waiter continually asked me what I wanted as my sides and I explained the same what I ordered before.  Then it dawned on me that of about 7 staff on duty, none of them spoke good english.  When I travel/live overseas, I don't expect english spoken, however considering this is a Western/American restaurant and given the prices they charge here, you definitely expect the staff to speak english.  Then we ordered one of our favourite non-alcohol drinks in Nepal, a lemon soda water which has been consistent among restaurants since our arrival.  The bartender asked if we wanted salt or sugar in ours (never been asked this before) so we ordered salt…wow, it really is the most horrible tasting drink I have had…like it was mixed with sulphur and I cannot imagine this flavour would ever appeal to any foreigner. 

The food came out.  I have to say I liked the coleslaw and the cajun french fries.  They were good, however the burgers (we had both beef & chicken) were really ordinary and I cannot understand previous comments about this.  Really, it was overpriced albeit the sauces were nice.  [As a suggestion, there is a cafe in Lalitpur called Soma (not fancy) but they do terrific burgers for a really good price].  So no, I can't imagine ever calling this place 'the best burger in town'.

We also couldn't relax because as we sat at the bar, the bartender kept pacing back & forth for about 30 minutes.  I politely asked him if he could find something to do, but of course he didn't understand me.

The restaurant walls were dirty and paint chipped in big areas especially near the bar which didn't leave a great impression.  Well with 7 staff working and two tables, perhaps several could have been busy making this place look nice for the prices that are charged.  The atmosphere really stank actually.

A previous writer said don't waste your time-- i have to agree.  It's really a shame with this beautiful view there isn't a sophisticated upscale restaurant that would be deserving of these prices with a  useful and well trained staff.  We were very happy to leave and walked 10 minutes to 'Mezze' by Roadhouse--very sophisticated & upscale (across from the Royal Palace) and had a beautiful bottle of wine and wine that was very deserving of the price on a 4th floor balcony instead.  The prices ironically are cheaper here.  

To the owner ('Brian') perhaps; you really need to lift your standard in many ways and I really hopes this provides useful to you.  You provide a bad example and bad management to your establishment.

The irony?  Would I return?  Yes, only for a cold beer, sitting on the balcony to show the view to my future visitors and in hopes that I see some sort of changeMore",2

"BRIAN'S GRILL HOUSE, Kathmandu - Restaurant Reviews, Photos & Phone Number - Tripadvisor","Mexican, American, Bar, Barbecue, Pub","Reviewed September 6, 2013 ",Best Beef Pattie In Town,"Brian's Grillhouse attempts to replicate an American saloon in the centre of Kathmandu. It is located on the 9th floor of an office building and give a spectacular view of the northern part of the city. When I went the balcony was full of local...businessmen partying.
I chose to eat the Oregon burger. It was one of the best burgers I've had in KTM. The pattie is the tastiest beef pattie in town by a long way. I could have ordered five of them and ate nothing else. The cheese and bun were also good. However, I was a little disappointed in how they prepared the onion. I was expecting it to be fried like they would in the US, but it wasn't. They left it like they would for a salad.
Service here was fine. They were very enthusiastic about taking my order and catering to my needs when I first arrived. However, this attention waned as the evening went on. The kitchen staff were extremely quick to prepare my burger though.
One downside was that the staff decided to crank Gangnam Style at obnoxious levels halfway through my meal. This was probably at the request of the Nepalese businessmen that were doing tequila shots at the bar. I found this to really annoying and really took away from the American atmosphere that was created.
Brian's Grillhouse is on the expensive side of restaurants in Kathmandu. So if you are dining on a budget, I certainly wouldn't recommend it. If you are craving a tasty 100% beef hamburger though, Brian's should be your first stop.More",4

Unfortunately I was very disappointed.
The restaurant is centrally located in the Dilli Bazar area of Kathmandu on the 9th floor of a highrise....There is both indoor and outdoor seating and the view is awesome.There is no ambience.
The food was ordinary and the drinks over priced. The waiters were pleasant  enough but service was terrible. There was an American guy at the bar who appeared to be the manager but was least interested in what was happening in the restaurant. He was more busy fiddling with his laptop.
Believe me, there are much, much better places in Kathmandu to eat and drink and chill out.
This is a joint best avoided.More",1

It is located high-atop a building on the outskirts of Kathmandu. The bar and tables spill out onto a very large and well appointed roof top patio. There are fantastic 360degree views of the city and the  Himalayas off in...the distance. It is well run and the staff are friendly. From fantastic salads, burgers and pastas through to cutting edge cocktails, tapas and late-night dancing, Brian's is well worth a visit and you are sure to find something you have been craving, be it food or beverage.

The wings (although small, not their fault... poultry is very small here) are excellent. The mendu can be found on their Facebook page and is similar to your typical...""sports bar"" menu. Everybody got something different and all of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals. It is a bit expensive, though, and hopefully they'll do something about that in the near future. My only real complaint would be about the drink ordered. I got a margarita and well, it was basically watered down tequila -- no flavor at all.

They serve a...wide range of starters, steaks and burgers and the staff is exceptional. We got the chance to talk to Brian, the owner, a very friendly guy who makes a point of providing an authentic American experience. The staff is amazingly well trained and they do everything to make you feel welcome. While we were there, the place was pretty empty so the service might be different if the place is crowded, but we had two staff looking after us snd it took them only a few seconds to offer you a new beer or even light up your cigarette!

The clientele is made up partly of tourists, expats living in Kathmandu and the local high society.

Not being an American I can't compare it to the real deal but I can safely say that Brian prepared the best Burger I ever had!

It's not exactly cheap and one of the most ""expensive"" places we've been to in Kathmandu with starters beginning at 4$ and burgers being around 7$ - 12$ and the beer (imported) is also priced higher than in other places. With 10% service charge and 13% VAT expect to pay around 20$ - 25$ per person (if you're hungry and have 1 or 2 beers) but the price to value ratio still makes this place a great deal, especially if you're tired of Dhal Baat after a 2 week trek.
