We sat on the first floor, we asked the chef for recommendations, to which he suggested veg dahi ke kebab in starters and 1 crispy roll he made for us stuffed with paneer and cheese and were really nice in taste, even dahi ke kebab was awesome. A must try just melt in the mouth.
For main course we ordered a mix pasta, fried rice and veg Manchurian . Pasta was amazing really nice in taste, and even fried rice and Manchurian were yummy. Apart from this we had a melon mocktail, virgin mojito they were nice too.

"ROOTS RESTURANT, Bengaluru - Menu, Prices & Restaurant Reviews - Tripadvisor","Chinese, Indian","Reviewed July 23, 2018 ",Back to Roots..,"Have been to this place quite a few times before too, but those were for official meetings. This time, had a dinner plan with friends here, and how we loved it!

So, this place has a rustic décor , with soothing music in background, making...it more suitable for sit down dinners/lunches. We tried almost all the items since we were a big group of 10, and glad to say, almost all of them impressed us barring just a few!

We started with the Watermelon and Feta salad, fresh in it’s own way, and presented beautifully(the small round scoops of watermelon with sprinkled feta cheese was a visual delight too); followed by the Mullagawatany soup(a thick lentil based soup) for the vegetarians, and the Hot and Sour one for the non-vegetarians in the group. Both the soups had set the standard high.

Next came up their Stuffed Paneer Tikka(had a stuffing of dry fruits), post which came up their famous Dahi k Kebab; we could never imagine that one could get these typical North Indian delicacies cooked to perfection in Bangalore! Extremely soft, well bound and melt in the mouth types, this one was the favorite amongst all. The Chicken tikka that we had was okayish. Actually we were too happy with the veg ones, for a change.

For main course, we have their Dal Makhni, Paneer Khurchan, Mangalore style Prawns curry with Rice, Chicken Ghee Roast with Appam. To be noted here, their Dal Makhni is an extremely safe bet, very well made, it went well with the accompanying breads. But the Chicken ghee roast was disappointing; it did not have the authentic Mangalorean flavor at all; but if you take it as a normal chicken preparation, then it would be fine, but definitely not a ghee roast. The Mangalore style Prawns was quite good, and we belted it off with rice.

After all this, we just wanted couple of deserts and went for the Fried icecream, the regular Mud Pie and Malpua with Rabri(best one).

The best part of this place is their very reasonable pricing. They also offer 2+2 n drinks, courtesy Zomato gold. Highly recommended for group lunches/dinners!More",5.00

Walk down the entire bazaar road to the talkies junction, cross over to the bus-stop side, look for small place called Gurukripa on the left, enter and take a seat.  Don’t be dissuaded...by the humble appearance of the place, instead let your tastebuds play judge for a change. I had the tastiest north-Indian food in my life there. Ever. The food is really at a different level, and an unlimited thali costs an incredibly reasonable 60 rupees (like, 1 dollar). I returned there for every meal during my stay, and despite always being the only woman in the room no one stared or passed idiotic comments, they were in fact least interested. I can’t decide whether that says a lot about me, or speaks well of them, or just points to the level the food reaches – maybe it’s all three.  The restaurant is run by two polite, smiling Sardar brothers and their father. They refill your plate with hot rotis and vegtables and dal before you need it, and persuade you to have a little more when you refuse any more food (""ek aur roti to lijiye"") - true Punjabi hospitality. I spotted a clean and orderly kitchen, the food is served hot and fresh, the menu changes completely for lunch and dinner, leaving me with no worries about falling ill later.

Today my family and I  had lunch at Annalakshmi along with our family doctor and his wife  on the eve of his 76th  birthday ....When ever I step into this Annalakshmi Restaurant my  memory  always goes to Shri Ramani Guruji aka Swamy Santhanand Saraswathi,  who used to receive diners personally with a warm smile standing  at the entrance to  Annalakshmi restaurant , which  opened out in Chennai opposite LIC in Mount Road ,several decades ago .

In those days food served in his  Annalakshmi restaurant  was mainly prepared by  of his ardent  devotees  comprising of mostly  professionals and  houswives .They used to 
Cook excellent food at home as per age old recipes akin to their own  mother's cooking  and bring it over to the restaurant to serve it to guests as  dedication to Guruji and his charitable  missions.
 
But In this restaurant now  located in their own building on spurtank Road, these days high quality  food is churned out everyday in their modern kitchen , by a team of dedicated and loyal chefs who are all well trained by the same  Swamiji's disciples years ago , in the art of traditional  recipes they used to make at home and serve in the Mount Road  restaurant ,when Swamiji was around .

It's note worthy to hear  that , even today a few old disciples still do step in to provide fresh inputs to their Chefs of many years .

This restaurant has been designed  to perfection by the proffessional devotees  with pleasing art decor and dining in cool  Ac comfort here is indeed a real pleasure .

This premise has  adequate carparking 
and includes a  party hall in 2nd level for  conduct of small family functions like sashtiapthapoorthy, 
Birthdays ,upanayanam etc .

Looking at the large number of senior citizens among their diners , I am sure the
Food served here must  certainly be very comforting  to most  .

Dear friends , you don't have to take my word  when I mention that  there is no restaurant in Chennai  which serves south Indian thali meals with such high quality & finesse, that is sure to thrill  any diner from across the globe.

You can check it out for yourself,  but please do so through advance booking .

What will catch the attention of diners will surely be the artistic  ambience ,cleanliness, hospitality with smile by volunteers and culinary taste at its best and  wide spread of items  included in  their thali  everyday .

Director Shri Aravind  and his family is always around to supervise the operation every day .

I for one,  am able to  appreciate the
tremendous efforts their dedicated team puts  into selection and sourcing  of fresh  vegetables ,condiments and other items for daily cooking of sathvic food  served here  in traditional style ,without  use off any cold storage facilities .

I also appreciate the wonderful gesture extended by the management  to their entire team of volunteers by making sure they are provided with good food in the  restaurant itself , before service starts for  guests. 

The management I understand also  takes care of their children's education of needed .

Dining here is indeed a wonderful experience and one can notice  smiles  in the face of every  diner, who exits this  restaurant after a joyful meal. !More",5.00

"ANNALAKSHMI RESTAURANT, Chennai (Madras) - Nungambakkam - Menu, Prices & Restaurant Reviews - Tripadvisor","Indian, Asian, Healthy","Reviewed October 6, 2022 ","Review of Annalakshmi restaurant @ No 6  Mayor Ramanathan Road, Chennai.","Today I had the opportunity to dine in this temple of culinary delight called 
Annalaksmi .
I believe this restaurant is  driven by divine forces,  perhaps because  its name itself  is  derived from goddess Lakshmi for Annam or food,  not to mention the fact that...its blessed by its founder Swami Shanthanand Saraswathi aka to some fondly as Ramani guruji,  himself a disciple of swami Sivanandha of Risihikesh.

Trust me this is just not a restaurant that serves south Indian and north indian food as fine dining at its best but an institution that serves the community at large through art and free health care  through their charitable institution spread across 4 countries namely Singapore Malaysia Australia and India .The revenues generated from this restaurant along with other public donations goes to sustain their charitable  efforts 
I still have fond memories of Guruji standing at the entrance of Annalakshmi,  when he started this restaurant way back in 80's on Anna salai opposite famous iconic LIC building and receiving his guests with a smile in true indian vedic tradition of "" Athithi devo bhava"" while his retinue of disciples comprising of  professionals and housewives would  volunteer and prepare homely food in the kitchen and  serve  the  guests to this  restaurant .

The idea of a  charitable movement to serve community at large was  born in swamiji's mind and in  1984 in Jalan Bangsar Baru , Kaulalumpur , Malaysia  Annalakshmi restaurant came into being and spread from there to Singapore  India and Australia .
Swamiji's idea was  to bring togather the culinary skills of mothers and grandmothers among  his group of disciples who have been feeding their loved ones with tender care  dedication.

Swamiji wanted to draw upon their heritage  skills of creating delightful & nutritious nourishments  from fresh ingradients sourced on daily basis avoiding any inputs from any cold storages facilities .

Swamiji empowered these housewives to serve the larger family of the community through their homely skills honed through traditions and practices .

But today there are proffessional chefs who churn out the same food with same fine taste , after  being trained by swamiji's  disciples .

In simple words Annalakshmi is like  one's own home where one can go to eat to their  hearts content while enjoying  themselves in plush ,luxurious and artistically created environment .
The  payment you make is  not just  for the great food served in true hospitality  but also to help their chatitable trust to sustain  their good work both in fine arts  and free  health care centres .

This restaurant is presently managed well by Mr Aravind and his other family members , all of whom I understand are disciples of swamiji .

To their credit , they have now started another restaurant and sweet shop named Mayur next to this Annalakshmi restaurant  under the aegis of the same trust .
For those wanting to have a family function , party or an event , the restaurant in its present own location offers two floors for holding them with a capacity to serve 500 people .

Dining in Annalakshmi is an experience one will never forget and to those travellers from other countries I say this ."" If you want to experience true south Indian culture , hospitality and  its fine culinary delights look nowhere else .Head straight to Annalakshmi restaurant. 
It will be an experience you will cherish and take back fond memories of having enjoyed great meal with full satisfaction .""More",4.00

"VARR - TEMPLE FOOD OF INDIA, Rishikesh - Menu, Prices & Restaurant Reviews - Tripadvisor",Indian,"Reviewed June 16, 2022 ",A Restaurant Meal Meant to be in Bucket of 100 Things to Do Before I Die,"Varr- The Temple Restaurant is a hidden gem in the precints Rishikesh. It is a captive property of HolyWater by Ganga Kinare' hotel, but dining is with reservations and walk-in for both inhouse guests and external visitors.

It its located 200 metres from its sibling...propery ' Gange Kinare Boutique hotel' on Veerbhadra Road, Rishikesh.

Concept:
The theme and concept of Varr (read as 'Var' in Hindi for Vardan' is unique and fascinating with its Artisinal Thalis aggregated around various temples, religious institutions and deities.
Entire interiors are done in mild mustard and saffron colours with all servings on Bell Metal utensils.

I applaud the vision of Chef Anuj Kapoor and the team of Sandeep Bhatt, leading the hopitality.

Food:
- Menu is consolidated into 'Temple Bhog Thalis' - Utsav, Rachna, Naivedayam & Anandam
- Each Thali is rotated by a day
- Food items are  famed prasadams or linked to popular worship institutions and deities
- Each Meal is initiated by Achchaman (Purity ritual) and Charna-Amrit is given to all guests.
- Subsequently, udhyapan puja is done with Mantra and Chants by Mr. Sandeep Bhatt, Restaurant Manager
- Dhuan Chaas and Sheetal Samagri (a mildly sweet and fragrant drinking water)
stole my heart.

A special mention is of the Team -
Mr. Sandeep Bhatt, the Restaurant Manager and his team go out of the way to make it an extremely amazing experience.

He patiently explains each item on the menu and lovingly exhorts the guests to take more servings, similar to a meal at home. 
With a lineage from a Brahmin Acharya Famly, his knowledge of mantra,scriptures and foundation of each item on menu, compliments the experience. He furthers it by conducting Udhyapan Puja before a meal.

Having travelled widely across India and abroad, I haven't seen anything like Varr. One visit is not enough and I left wanting more. 
Residing 300 kilometres from Rishikesh, I'm actually planning to driven down 1 weekend to taste other Bhog Thalis.

Probably would request Founder Owner Mr. Gulati, to consider expanding Varr- Temple Food of India, to other regions too.More",5.00

This could be because the ingredients stand in the open right next to the road all day. The taste of the Dum Aloo was so bad that I only had one small bite before deciding I was going to leave and find another restaurant. 

I sent all the food back and I told the waiter why I was returning it. I said I was not going to eat the food but that I would pay for it and asked for the bill. The waiter called the manager and I was stopped from leaving the restaurant because they were insisting that I order something else. This was embarrassing. 

Eventually, I managed to get the bill from the cashier, who was making a point of trying to embarrass me further. He made an even bigger point of taking my money. It was very awkward.   

The quality of the food is poor, the ingredients are not fresh, the restaurant has no vibe or atmosphere and there were mosquitoes everywhere, the staff were just plain nasty - I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.More",1.00

I am a real devout to this place since I don’t remember when; though I am very late writing this review here. The multilayered orchestra of flavours that devote more to...the artistry of cooking than the mere use of correct masalas and heat. They don’t just serve food here but they serve an age old legacy, tradition and discipline (the awesomeness in the taste gets better every-time you discover something new on their menu), I recently tried vegetable Singapuri which was a true delight, mushroom Saag was another great ensemble to my luncheon. It is every foodies Dream Déjeuner Palace. If you want to commit to an elaborate lunch or dinner don’t forget to try the famous Veg Thali here. Even the veg pizza here is great too, if you don’t want a ton on your plate its is a satiety meal in its own. On my last visit I asked to meet the owner to thank him for the great food, and he was so humble to come our table in the end to meet us; a very humble and beautiful soul Mr. Bhatia (He also gave us a generous discount on our bill). 
The overall experience here is mouthwatering, a true palatal delight that will make your tastebuds go dancing… 
Bottom line:
Staff - Well behaved,Courteous
Menu - Diverse and justifiable 
Ambience - Very earthy and refreshing

PROS: 
1) The ambience, Vibe and crowd is good.
2) The buffet spread is decent in terms of variety and cuisines. Lunch has more variety (in my view) compared to Dinner
3) The food tastes good...(Not amazing, not bad) 
4) The entire Staff is courteous and provide a great service. They listen to you and quickly help you in case of any special food requirements. Special mention to the manager Rahul Ahluwalia who made sure me and my family had everything what we needed. One of the best staff i have ever seen. 

CONS:

1) Almost everything (all snacks, main course and curries) was at room temperature and not Hot. They put food in hot plates and not on top of an electric stove or burners. However on asking to get hot food, Rahul and his colleagues quickly provided us with hot dishes what we asked.

Two days later, we were at the same place for lunch, somewhat late in the afternoon like 4:30PM. We ordered Nei Choru, Parottas, Fish Fry, Chicken curry and Fish Curry. All tasted good, particularly the fish fry was quite unique and tasted extremely good. It was like I never had it anywhere else, except one Malayali restaurant in Chennai called Kumarakom which is not that famous anymore. 

The building and ambiance looks old, but kept neat and clean. Surprisingly the breakfast was pretty cheap, like Rs. 400 for 3 people. The lunch was quite expensive, due to the fish dishes we ordered, still its worth the money. 

I would strongly recommend this place for anyone landing in Kozhikode for anytime, breakfast, lunch or dinner. This is both cost effective and tasty. I will never miss it whenever I visit Kozhikode.More",5.00

"LA UPPU, Mysuru (Mysore) - Menu, Prices & Restaurant Reviews - Tripadvisor","Indian, Southwestern, Asian",Reviewed 4 weeks ago ,Service of the Staff is a big Issue. Leaving a Few.,"I am writing this review as I was not only staying in Grand Mercure but used 'La Uppu' for my Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner. 
During my first day of stay had lunch which was amazing esp. the Methi Murg, Vast Selection of Veg/Non-Veg, Desserts etc....In the Dinner we found that most of the items were repeated as to what was served in lunch.
Where it setbacks is during the breakfast as during our 3-day stay there was no change in the buffet menu not even one single item whatsoever. 

The biggest drawback of restaurant:
1. One and only staff while this problem goest with most of the Accor hotels I have stayed in. Didn't expect the same in Grand Mercure.

2. Totally reluctant staff they will avoid looking at you so they don't need to handle any guest request. For Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner we had to literally wait sometimes for 15min+ so one of the staff can listen to the request.

3. At Breakfast when checked with one of the staff they only had omlets, Dosa at live station. But when Tapas came to help us he gave us the whole range like bacon, Sausages etc. (So Accor need to look into this issue why this happened that one staff is totally reluctant even to spit out whole menu that is available while other tells a different story).

3. Sanjay the manager was good enough to come and listen to our feedback on our last day. 

4. The whole restaurant credit even for 2 stars go to Tapas (Super-Energetic, Always Helpful, Quick - Service, If he wouldn't have told us about more food options available at live coking during breakfast we would have never come to know what all is really available).

5. Restaurant should have gems like Tapas who make guest feel they are sitting in a 5-star restaurant which easily can go otherwise looking at other staff behavior.More",2.00

What we were served was not even warm, not to mention it did taste awful. And when we brought it to the notice of their staff, they were not ready to accept. They did a lot of time pass and our breads were getting cold in the wait of their reply.  Finally I called them again and asked to get me another dish, they may charge for their today's special also, but throw it in dustbin.

From my previous visit to Puri, some 15 years ago, I remembered this restaurant to be at the ground floor of Hotel Pulin Puri. Bhojohari Manna was an upcoming,...talk-of-the-town brand at that time. This time around, found it to be shifted to a new address, but the good part is that they retained the quality and the taste.
The restaurant is located in the lane adjacent to Puri Hotel, some 50 meters from the Sea Beach Road. The dining area is rather small, but nicely put up with visually soothing and comfortable ambience. Staff are very efficient and polite. And above all, found the food to be tasty with a few scope for improvements.
My recommendations are Rongpuri Fish Fry, Kosha Mangsho, Daab Chingri and Basanti Pulao. Found the jumbo Chital fish to be a bit tasteless (not the gravy but the fish itself) and the luchi could be better (most of them were flat and not 'phulko').

We entered the restaurant around 7.28pm since we have our supper early
There was a long table available in the first section...of the restaurant 
We asked for it - since my Mom in Law- has problems walking 
Now here our experience of going there was already ruined- Jashn Chhabra (Restaurant manager) refused us that table on the pretext that it was reserved- at that point of time - in the whole restaurant the occupancy was perhaps 10-20% - & even it was reserved- seeing the condition of the seniors- he should’ve considered that - since there were entire sections - Empty - he could have easily reallocated the tables
On top of that - he was rude & went & stood in a corner - instead of taking us to the next table 
Anyhow we were seated - & then when we complained - since that table was empty till the time we left (10.30pm)
Abhimanyu Agarwal started justifying his team’s actions- which was completely unacceptable 
No Empathy at all

This multi-cuisine restaurant will surely win your heart with the quality of food they serve and...atmosphere they have created!

There are variety of reasons why we won't think twice before recommending this restaurant, especially if you are planning to dine out with family.

We are highly impressed with the ambience of Utsav Restaurant. The traditional wall hangings perfectly compliment the beautiful pieces of artworks and carvings on the wall. The sitting arrangement is pretty well taken care of and the soulful instrumental soundtracks certainly adds to the overall dining experience. The best part is that there isn't much disturbance due to the limited seating, which makes it a perfect place to enjoy your family conversations without any worries.

The best part about the food served here is that you won't be disappointed with any kind of cuisine. We tried out various kinds of dishes and the way this restaurants manages to keep up with the taste and professionalism of each cuisine is simply commendable.

As far the starters are concerned, the freshness of the Tomato soup as well as the Manhow soup touched our hearts as soon as we took the first sip. The Tomato soup was topped with sufficient amount of cream and butter where as the Manchow soup was accompanied with more than enough fried noodles.

Though we would like to mention that the starter we ordered was not up to the mark, it tasted good but the crisp which is an essential in Veg Crispy seemed to be lacking somewhere.

Finding an authentic Sizzling Chocolate Brownie is one tough task in Nashik but glad we have found yet another restaurant that serves an appetizing brownie in the city. The brownie was served sizzling hot and the pineapple base as well as the juicy cherry on top provided made it taste even more awesome!

Old timers will realise that this new avatar is a complete disaster. Absolutely nothing about this is what the iconic Jyoti Vihar was for Kolkatans. 
The ground floor which was not used earlier...has been revamped and in a cramped up area plastic tables and chairs have been some how fitted in hardly any space between two tables and absolutely no space next to each other in the table that you would sit in. There is loud , bright , garish menu board against the wall in front of a counter which serves as a talk away and self help counter. 
The staff is all gone and there is only person to serve who inspite of his best efforts is overwhelmed. 
The food is atrocious and the way it is served makes it look absolutely unpalatable. A dosa is folded to fit into a tiny plastic plate. The idly dipped in sambar which was what most people ordered there for years now comes in a shallow glass dish. The idly as hard as a rock and the dosa seemed to have been fried!! Clearly shows the kitchen staff too is gone. In all probability this place seems to have changed ownership.

The Manager was so courteous that not only he allowed us to have lunch but also provided a chair for my wife and he took full care of us. The taste of food was beyond explanation and we could not believe that such a good food could be provided in Indore. This was a buffet system and the varieties were many more than required. Every dish was competing with the other. We enjoyed food for about 45 minutes and then thanked the Manager and the other waiters and left.

The concept is focused to bring the finest ingredients flown in from Thailand and exborant cocktail menu inspired with Thai ingredients are a highlight here.

The...place has high energy, interiors are expectedly classy. The ingredients speaks of freshness, coupled with Spot-on taste as well as presentation. 

Chicken Dimsums with Thai - Chilli Oil is something good to start with. Wok tossed chicken is a good option if you like stir fried type of chicken. 

Vegetarians or Non-vegetarians - you shouldn't miss Roti Canai !! It's a Roti with Avacado & Curried Pepper Mayo. Satay Alam is their version of Chicken Satay, served with steamed bao's. 

They Appetisers section is perfect to appease any of the palate. The menu has influence of another cuisine - American braisserie as well, they are perfectly corporated in the menu. I still need to explore that part, and look forward to try in my nect visit. 

The main course ordered were humble Red Thai Curry and Jaismine Rice. But fret not, our focus was all on the desserts. We didn't left without trying the coveted Mango Pudding with sticky Rice. And the last thing we have tried is Triple Layered Semi Fredo , Katafi & Gritty Milk.More",5.00

"TYGR, Mumbai - Lower Parel - Restaurant Reviews, Photos & Phone Number - Tripadvisor","Asian, Thai","Reviewed October 12, 2019 ",New Menu At TYGR is amazing,"Long ago, people would remember their traveling days for different delicacies and cuisines, but now they can discuss it in their social gatherings. With cultural influence and access to new ingredients, everything can is custom made ss per the taste and preference. Giving innovative thoughts...to Mumbaikar’s appetite, Zorawar Kalra, owner of Massive Restaurant’s, built TYGR for the tantalizing palate as well as for voracious eaters.

 

TYGR looks debonair in the elegant Palladium Mall (Lower Parel) and is an adobe for Thai cuisines & American food. The word TYGR denotes “roar of a tiger” and manifest an all-day-dining restaurant. The semicircle bar lit up in hue of golden is captivating and inevitable with a large display of drinks. As you move in the palatial realm, there are different forms of tiger prints across the walls with Goldfish motifs for prosperity and good luck. Rattan chairs, Thai bamboo sticks, and Japanese chandelier best describe the physical appearance of TYGR.

 

TYGR is quite for lunches in the afternoon, fun for drinks in the evening, and by night it turns into a full night club for special gatherings and parties. Everything inside the lounge-like setting is to relieve your stress and reinvigorate into a new start.

 

While Thai cuisines dominate the menu, TYGR also offers American grills and Japanese cuisines too. The mouth-watering and flavorsome dishes are worth every bite. The Parched Chicken Miang Kham is full of fresh ingredients and fun to eat with Michigan plums and raw mango. Ika Rings (deep-fried squids) is crisp and topped with flamed coconut & yam dressing. The Fennel Tiger Prawns taste juicy and meaty with tender prawns doing the magic. Roti Canai, one of the staff’s recommendations, is dressed up in avocado and multiple curried pepper mayo. For mains, there is Wok Tossed Chicken rice with fried chilies and cashew accompanied with Tofu curry truncated with soft roasted peanuts.

 

Triple-Layered Semi Fredo with Katafi & Gritty Milk dessert is dense and mouthful. It will just be a great ending to your meal journey.

 

TYGR recreates a food scene that is simple and uncomplicated. With Thai and American cuisines circling the tables, this place is bound to please one and all. So be it lunch or party, there is something for everyone.

"MCDONALD'S, Muzaffarnagar - Menu, Prices & Restaurant Reviews - Tripadvisor",,"Reviewed March 31, 2019 ",Convenient and large,"This is one of the most convenient places to stop for a break near Muzaffarnagar. While the rest of Namaste Midway has been renovated and most of the earlier brands moved out of here, McDonald’s is still there. I had last visited this McDonald’s a...couple of years ago, on a very crowded and busy day, so my memories of it are a little hazy, but I think this has been refurbished too, at least somewhat: the furniture etc looked all new and shiny.

The food is the usual predictable McDonald’s fare, not gourmet, not even good for you, but dependable. I had a filet-o-fish burger (would have liked more tartar sauce on that) and a bag of fries (I don’t patronize McDonald’s usually, so hadn’t realized they’re introduced peri-peri fries: the plain salted fries come with a sachet of peri-peri spice powder and a paper bag in which you tip the fries and the spice mix, shake them up well—and your peri-peri fries are ready. I don’t like much spice, so these weren’t a hit with me, but I can imagine that most spice-loving Indians would welcome these. 

I also had an iced tea (nice) and a chocolate brownie soft serve. The latter, a serve of vanilla ice cream with a tiny walnut brownie stuck on top and a drizzle of chocolate sauce, was surprisingly nice: much better than I’d expected.More",3.00

Food is out of taste. No one even bothered for asking that if we required something else.  The resturant is very ill managed and their staff needs a lot of traning they even don't know how to welcome their guests. Go their resturant at your own risks and if want to spoil your evening. 
My advised is to hotel management is that kindly check their resturant staff and give some proper training for handling their guests properly in a good way.
My rating for their resturant is one star only because of not having a option for less than one.

That is the reason, it is perfectly occupied even on weekends. We did not find a huge crowd waiting in queues to get in as in most other places....The place is nice although slightly hot with ceiling fans blowing above our heads.

However, the specialty of the place is that they offer the best of the breed, Continental, Indian, Chinese, Afghani, you name it and you have a few items of every cuisine. What is even better is that like most other similar places which claim to be multi cuisine, they don't loose the plot midway. I tried Indian in terms of Zaffrani Chicken. Continental in terms of Fish with chips, Italian Pasta and their popular Shepherd's Pie. All of them tasted quite awesome. The quantity were adequate and the service was decent if not super quick (We didn't mind as we all wanted some time)

Five star rates in a below average hotel . . ,"Don't get fooled by so many positive  reviews for this restaurant. . I went to this resturant after reading so many positive feedbacks . . 
Inspite of so many positive reviews , no one knew about this resturant even the shop keepers in the next...building were not familiar with resturant.
However , I reached the resturant , which is in Hotel Vir Sai near Sai baba temple. 
The resturant was empty. We asked for the menu card but the waiter told us that they do not have one. He told us some dishes verbally and quoted rates which sounded reasonable. 
We ordered just one vegetable , two roti , one dal and one plane rice . . 
To our shock , he told me that I need to pay Rs. 725/-. I was still in shock as this hotel is not even a One star property. I still asked him for a printed bill so the waiter said the printer is not working. He asked us to make the payment at the reception counter.
The shock continues . . The reception staff some Mr Vijay asked me to pay Rs 810/- saying that the waiter was wrong in calculating the bill. . 
Can you believe this , the trick is they will not show you any menu card and then ask for any amount as they wish and not give you any bill as well. . 
After I put my foot down , saying that I must get a bill , they some how produced a fake bill with no registration number and no tax , printed on a letter head . .

These are the natural plus points for which we chose it for our family dinner (6 adults+ 2 kids).
 
The service was a huge let down. 
- Lemon coriander...soup had to be cancelled as coriander had FINISHED. That was informed 20 min after the order. 
-  A fresh lime soda took so long that I cancelled it. 
-  The food was just left on table by the waiter(no serving) especially when the table area made it difficult to pass the utensils amongst ourselves. 
- In the second half reordered the fresh lime with two other mocktails. The contents were all wrong. On enquiry neither the bartender nor the restaurant manager turned up, despite waiting for additional 45 minutes. ( they did not charge for the wrong mix though- but that still made my daughter miss the drink she wanted with her food) 

Summary. 
1.pathetic service and ' don't give a dime' attitude of staff, manager. 
2. Food quality was average. 
3. No feedback system by the management.

We thought food will be nice and restrooms will be clean but restrooms were more...dirty than one can imagine. After we complaint to the manager... he quickly appologized and told us that we can use a different restroom on the backside. 
Its so frustrating that you will make your guest goes through such bad experience and only if one raises his/her voice...you provide another option. They lied on top saying that the dirty restroom is closed when there was no such sign and lots of their staff were just standing there never told anyone. 
I saw so many kids, mothers, older people struggling to use bathroom and staff like myself with no choice when on road trip.

FOOD: We ordered Chinese food for kids and told them specifically the spice level to be #1. The food came cooked with red and black peppers. It was just too spicy for kids to eat. The chicken used was old and very hard chew making it inedible. 
On our complaint- They did remake one of the dish for the kids but it came too late. They also took one dish of the charge as well.

The dining rooms boasts of amazing views at night, it’s elegantly decorated in colonial style with a bunch of artefacts kept everywhere around and delivers a...truly “Sahib” experience. Their newly appointed Chef Taj has done a wonderful job in reprising the menu which was already perfect. The Sahib room does justice to The Awadhi Cuisine in every possible way. The food is extremely well balanced, so aromatic that it’s tempting from a distance and has the characteristic of Gilawat in most of the dishes (minimal effort required in chewing). The best way to sample kebabs is to opt for the Sampling Platter. Loved all of them, super tender. Star was obviously the Gilawat kebab, probably the best I ever had after ITC’s Kakori (Sorry the Dum Pukth’s version is still unbeatable). Next we ordered the Sahib ki Nihari and Sahib ki Dal e Khaas which were definitely the best renditions I ever tasted. The balance of flavours was impeccable. Even the breads were fantastic. Have to try the Biryani next time. Coming to the service, everyone took good care of the table, it was non-intrusive. Have to especially give a shoutout to Chef Taj for customising some things and taking the time out to have interesting conversations about food with me and my dad (was celebrating my Dad’s bday). The team did everything and more to make our celebration memorable. My dad absolutely loved the food and was already making plans to return for a meal. The restaurant is soon going to get renovated and I feel super lucky to have experienced what the original Sahib  Room had to offer.

Restaurant manager Mr Bhagwan didnt really care for service. No server was assigned to our table and whenever we needed anything, we had to catch hold of someone passing by and ask for it.

We asked for still water and got served sparkling water. We asked for green salad and the chef gave us sliced cucumbers, sliced carrots and sliced tomatoes- I am sure a street vendor would have done a better job.

"THE EATERS, New Delhi - Greater Kailash I - Restaurant Reviews & Phone Number - Tripadvisor",,"Reviewed April 24, 2019 ",Launch of American Style Resturant In Delhi “The Eaters”,"Recently I have been to the newly opened Resturant in GK South Delhi which is specialized in American food. As we all love junk food and western culture even when we know we have to do more exercise today in the gym just because of...extra calories we had in our lunch, dinner or evening snacks. But who cares as long as its a matter of food because at the end of the day when we all gonna die it’s only food which is going with us not our money, value, fashion or extra push up in gyms.

So let me tell you all about this restaurant who are really good in taste, flavor, variety, serving etc. the best part of the restaurant is that they are really hygiene and they serve in Glass utensil.

First Of All, I would like to share their Menu Card in which all the variety and prices are mentioned.

I started with my all-time favorite burgers and at “The Eaters” they call it “The Spartan Sliders (Basically slides of 3 small burgers that too available in different colors like Green, Pink Black Purple Etc.)

They were tasty but very different in taste like Indian Burgers but anyways I will give this item 3.5/5 start rating.

The Trumps Price-239/- I had a drink Uptown Funk with Orange Slice Inside the drink I loved it a lot. Inside this drink, you will find some jelly cubes which were fantastic in the mouth.

I tried Glocko Pop Lemonade which was watermelon Drink really refreshing. and best drink for summers.

How can I forget Best French Fries I ever Had in a Bowl full of Cheese my love. I never like french fries of any place even the one I had in China was waste of money for but this place definitely had great taste I french fries.

The sandwich is great love especially when its full of cheese and taste so here we go with an amazing open sandwich which looks great and taste well.

First time in my life I loved Salad because it looks tasty and full of cheese and tasty stuff inside a bowl I call it Happiness in a bowl.

Hygiene- Its a matter of fact that if we are eating outside there should be hygiene because it directly affects our health. as their kitchen is in front you can see how it has been done.

Serving Method- They will serve you every liquid, salad in a beautiful glass jar even when you will order for home delivery they will serve you in the same kind of transparent glass jar through which you can see and feel what exactly inside t.

Food Quality- Amazing everything I tasted was having something great inside and which was making this restaurant food completely different and of course American.

Price- As per as the price concern is also not so high if we compare the quality and service they are providing to their customer.

Location- As we all know that south Delhi is already a very good and nice area of Delhi so we cant complaint about the location as its situated in GK 1 M Block Market.

Address- M-73, Shop 2, Greater Kailash-2, M Block Market, Block M, Greater Kailash II, Greater Kailash, New Delhi, Delhi 110048

Open Hours- 10:00 am to 11:00 pm

Phone: 011 4010 5459

Home Delivery – Yes

Visited this place 6 years ago. 
This time we were back in Trident Nariman Point and this restaurant is right 5 minutes back from our hotel. 
We were welcomed by the doorman and then the attending staff...displayed most warm service. They were very sensitive not to bring appetizers and main courses too quickly. Waiter Sattapa did the liaison with the kitchen for our specific needs. 
Virendra Yadav was at our table even before we waived our hands and looked after us so well. Ganesh gave his advice and explanation on dishes we were ordering. 
Finally manager Mr Suresh Pai and DN Misra could not help but came to talk to us and then it became a visit never to be forgotten. 
We were simply overwhelmed by an outstanding service given to us by all of the above and many more. 
Their place is always full but for them to give us so much attention is a testimony of the fact that Customer is God to them.

"JIMMY'S KITCHEN, Kolkata (Calcutta) - 7/1a Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Road Opposite Punjab National Bank - Restaurant Reviews, Photos & Phone Number - Tripadvisor",Vegetarian Friendly,"Reviewed January 3, 2020 ","A Place to Find the Authentic Flavour of ""Calcutta Chinese"" Food","80s was my teenage period, 70s was the decade when I first got taste of ""Calcutta Chinese"". Now, my daughter is about about to leave her teenage status. 

I was trying to share with my daughter the Kolkata Chinese flavour that I grew up with....That smoky flavour of Cantonese style noodles (Gravy Noodles, that we call it these days) and succulent roast pork. Jimmy's Kitchen was on the radar for quite some time, but somehow we missed it for some reason or the other. Finally, it was the day and we (with my wife and daughter) entered the Jimmy's.

I was taken back to the 70s and 80s with the decor. I could still identify the seating arrangement and looked for the tables where I sat with my father, mother and sister. I wanted to sit there, but they were already reserved. So, we got a table in one of the well decorated cubicles, (yes, you still get that cozy comfort of the cubicles).

We ordered shrimp noodles and roast pork. The food continued the nostalgia. At last, I got that smoky, moist flavour of Cantonese noodles that I got in my childhood and teenage days. I miss this flavour in  the modern ""Chinese"" restaurants. Finally, I could share my childhood experience of Chinese food with my daughter.

The price is like any other good Chinese restaurant and the quantity is ""OK"". One plate of noodles is enough for a person with good appetite. The roast pork was appreciated well by my daughter who found such item too dry at most of the other places. 

At last, the service. 

It was prompt. The food came within minutes of ordering.

I read in some reviews where the people were not very happy with the service. But to me the service was just of the right measure. The people did not intrude on your privacy, but were experienced enough to serve you the right thing at the right moment. I ordered two plates of noodles and asked them to serve a third plate after some time. It was served just when our plates were going to be empty, and served hot. The water glasses were filled as soon as they got empty.

I left with a happy experience, not only because I relived my childhood memories, but also because I could share such memory, in reality, with my daughter.

So I have memories of having eaten its food.  It is also a place that my friend has fond childhood memories of. So we both decided to go there after...yes, almost 20 years or more.
Bad...idea.
You can NEVER go back.
Anyway we had Fish fingers which was an excellent dish.8 pieces in all.We also wanted dumplings but the gent who took the order said it would take at least half an hour to be made afresh...so ....
Then we had mixed fried rice and chilli chicken boneless...Good enough except that the rice was tinged red and wasn't the fried rice I associate with Chinese cuisine in Calcutta (OK, Kolkata). Was it tasty. Yes...but it wasn't what I was expecting...hoping to get and the chilli chicken oozing oil, though Ok enough, fell far short of expectations.
Ah! Expectations...that's what is tripping up Jimmy's...it is more of a Bar now I see...and a group of loud hard drinking young boys and girls really spoilt our enjoyment of the food.
I found the prices extremely reasonable. The above mentioned items and one ice cream  cost us about Rs1100/-
In addition, my friend ordered noodles and chicken to take back home for those who couldn't come. Her feedback was not good the next day. Stringy, hard chicken and average noodles.
I brought back Chilli chicken on the bone (dry and stringy), fried rice (average) and Manchurian chicken (nothing to write home about).
So we laid the memories to rest.
Bottom line. Good enough place still if you are in the locality and hungry. But I wouldn't recommend it anew to someone as a must-try eatery nor drive down in a totally opposite direction from home to have a meal here.

A lot more's expected from a restraunt on the main road,"A so-so place for a family/friends outing. Slow staff (even though there are loads of them hanging around), very slow service, but palatable food. The slow service leads to locking of tables, and so, very slow movement of diners - leading to long waits standing...at the entrance. Reservations is a must if you plan to visit.
Offers ""packages"" for a variety of get-togethers - Kitty-party, celebration, and so on; OVERPRICED for the menu.
Chicken in creamy-garlic sauce was a new one, and worth a try. The soup hot-pot turned out to be a damper.

The food came after a long wait - we had ordered Indian dishes. The Dahi Baingan was not exotic or even close to being a restaurant cooked dish.

"LEMON TWIST (ORIENTAL WOK AND GRILL), Noida - Restaurant Reviews, Photos & Phone Number - Tripadvisor","Chinese, Asian","Reviewed October 3, 2012 ",Just about Okay...,"The menu has a good variety to choose from, it however lacks the description of
the dishes. The menu has too many categories, it needs to be simplified; the variety
however is worth a mention. 

We ordered ""Exotic mushrooms tossed in butter garlic sauce"": The...mushrooms arrived in
around 10 minutes The portion size was sufficient, but the presentation of the dish was below the restaurant standard. Mushrooms of varying sizes were kind of deep fried in butter garlic to the extent that some pieces had got burnt. The mushrooms clearly had not been tossed but deep fried. The mushrooms were served on a nice platter, the lettuce leaf and carrot decoration by the side looked old and stale.

The mild garlic flavor was good, the dish could have fared well had it not been
carelessly prepared.

Another dish that we ordered was Broccoli baby corn in hot sauce: The dish was mildly flavored and was not at all hot as the name suggested. Presentation of the dish again was a disappointment, the vegetables had lost their bright color and the dish looked dull and unappetizing.

We usually prefer a la carte, and both of us decided to have Continental, with Chinese style jade corn soup to start with....The soup arrived after some 20 minutes, and even to serve water, we had to struggle to get the wait-staff's attention.

The restaurant wasn't busy by any standards, some 40% occupied, maybe. In the table next to us, two gentlemen were being fawned over by one of the senior members of the wait staff, and also by a couple of waiters. I get that they might have some VIP eating that day, and they want to provide special service, but ignoring other paying guests is not on!

The soup was NOTHING BUT SWEET CORN SOUP WITH GREEN COLORING! :( It was pathetic, to say the least. We usually go there for the parking convenience, but even that wouldn't tempt me now. :(

The vegetable moussaka was okay; I had cannelloni, and instead of spinach and ricotta cheese, it was a shock to me that they had used spinach and mushrooms. If you're using mushrooms, you better mention it, as many Indian vegetarians prefer to avoid it. It was finely chopped and so I had to keep picking the mushrooms off!

The dessert was nice - we had fresh lychees with rabdi. Maybe a tad too sweet for our tastes, but otherwise it was okay.

I don't remember the service being this bad; a bunch of the waiters were just standing and chatting in one corner, and we had to keep waving our hands above our heads to get service!!!

Happened to visit it for lunch today, and incidentally they were having a ""Chettinad Festival"", which we were not aware of.

The decore was done up differently...which looked good, but the neon lighting was still on.

Isys serves a buffet at lunch, and this time it was a chettinad buffet with a host of different dishes.
There were 3 veg and 3 non-veg starters. I tried 3 among these including the chicken 65, mutton balls and gobi pakora. Also, the mutton soup, which was sadly full of bones!
None of them were memorable. Very ordinary.

For the mains there were many dry and gravy veggies, but i never like vegetarian dishes in chettinad cuisine. So i stuck to the fish curry and chicken pepper curry with rice. This was followed by some rasam. The rasam was good, but otherwise the food was very average.
 
There was also a live counter serving ghee roast idlis.

The dessert counter had 6-7 items, I tried the chandrahara which is one of my favourites. It was good unlike the dry and overly sweet rava ladoo. The ada payasam was not bad, but low on sugar.

Service was not bad, and pricing is not unjustified. But the main question is, does it deserve another visit? Probably not i'd say.More",3.00
"ISYS, Bengaluru - Jayanagar - Restaurant Reviews & Phone Number - Tripadvisor",Vegetarian Friendly,"Reviewed May 27, 2014 ",Great Ambiance and good food,"I went to Isys on a weekday with colleagues as it was our quarterly time out. In fact, we were a huge group, almost 30 people. The interior straight away caught my eye, lit in light blue giving a very serene feeling. The spread was...laid out neatly on one side. The spread looked quite interesting. 
I started with the soup, for a change it was a noodles veg soup, which was quite ok. At least, it was not the usual tomato soup like I find in many buffets. Like wise, there was at least one ""very different"" dish in main course, starters, and salads. Salads were quite good, am a big fan of cold pasta salad and Isys did not disappoint me. One stand out dish was the cold cut veg dish, which had round shaped paneer, cold and a dash of cheese added on top, served on a small leaf. Absolutely loved it. Cold cut meat is the norm, but never heard of cold cut veg dish. Both presentation and taste was good. Main course was also quite good, it had the usual biriyani, fried rice, one paneer dish, etc. But again one stand out dish was a south east asian dish, not able to remember the name, but had aubergine (brinjal) and other veggies in a sauce. It tasted quite good. Again thumbs up for providing another ""not so usual"" dish in the spread. There was also a live counter, they were making moong dal dosa. I am not sure if they always have the live counter or if they prepare different dish each time, however, I skipped it because this is something we make at home quite regularly. 
Moving on to dessert, the spread was again quite good. I guess the stand out dish was rabdi jalebi, but I liked all the other desserts on the offering too. At least they did not have fruits. I hate it when restaurants offer fruits and count them as desserts. 
Overall, I liked the buffet very much, though some of my other veggie colleagues did not like it that much. Non-veg lovers might like the place too. My ratings are as below.
Ambiance: 4/5
Food: 4.5/5 (Mainly because of the innovative dishes)

Food Taste - The Kerala Seafood cuisine was absolutely fabulous!...Fresh, chunky , tasty prawns, mussels cooked and presented very well. 

A MUST visit for some authentic FRESH seafood Kerala experience! 

NOTE for the Management: 

1. Music - You have taken all the trouble to deliver an authentic Kerala Experience. Why would you have different kinds of  loud music from hip-hop, trance, dubsteps in an authentic Kerala experience??!! Please change the music to a lovely Kerala ethnic Lounge music and ensure that the team are fully trained on the sound and the kind of music to be played. 

2. Your Kerala offerings are SO incredibly good. Just do not know why you are then offering all sorts of cuisines of this world starting from Thai, Chinese, North Indian etc. Etc.??! Today, it is about being a speciality restaurant of some specific cuisine. Since you are SO good in the local cuisine, why on earth would you try to become a Jack of all cuisine?? 

All customers when we were dining were ordering only Kerala cuisine too. 

Please market and get your identity/space based on your Kerala cuisine expertise and in case, someone insists or wants only other food , offer them a set menu option of other cuisine. Even your marketing communications talk about different other cuisine other than authentic Kerala cuisine . The slogan/tagline should just be - ""Authentic Kerala!""

Being in the hotel industry, my sincere advise would be for you to refocus back on your expertise and market that specifically all over. 

3. Menu Cards : Please update and process NEW menu cards / booklet. They seem to have NOT been replaced from the start of the restaurant. SO, unhygienic! 

To conclude, salute to the ownership for a fantastic concept, service and delivery of the cuisine!More",5.00

The manchow is a simple indian chinese soup hot and rich on flavour - this one was very salty with semicooked nudles on the top... Not crisp but chewy... Naaah! Cant really see the finesse...that you might expect from a restaurant attempting on delivering fine dining. The squid fry is more like a starter with some sad (small and thin sliced) pieces of squid. There is nothing fine in the squid fry other than the squid. The red onion and  limeleafs are totally killing the taste of of the puny squid and the heavy texture of the coconut is taking away the sensation of the slender squid. The chilis are strong in both dishes but that is ok - its the flavours that are unbalanced/unrefined leaning towards pungent in both dishes. Might be your thing? They have a wide menu so go find out.

We were advised to sit at the 'Cascades' because the AC was not working properly at 'Wok Tok'.
However the AC was not working efficiently at Cascades either. There was even a fly...there.
The food left a lot to be desired.

A detailed FOOD review
SOUPS - 2 Manchow chicken, 2 Sweet corn vegetarian & 1 Clear Chicken Soup (1 by two) - Decent 7/10
STARTER - Chicken Chilly Mountain - great taste BUT not hot enough in spite of delayed service. It was room temperature. - Effectively 5/10.
MAIN COURSE:
- Chicken Kung Pao - horrible, drenched in excessive Soya Sauce and full of cashew nuts. It was sweetish bitter and sour - not like the same dish we eat at most places  - 3/10
- Hakka Sliced Lamb - Very good - 8/10
- Silken Tofu with Chilly Bean - Very good 8/10
- Chilly Chicken (outside the menu) - Ordinary but edible - 5.5/10
- 2 Veg Fried Rice - Alright - 6/10
- Veg Hakka Noodles - Above Average - 7/10
DESSERTS:
- 3 Jaggery Ice Creams - Alright - 6/10
- Date Pancake - Alright but with horrid crystallized ice cream - 5/10

PRICING
The pricing was EXCESSIVE - we paid 17,500/- for all of the above + a bottle of water - too much considering that:
1. This restaurant is ALWAYS almost EMPTY – Cascades is also never more than half full AND
2. The Grand is NO Taj, Oberoi or similar brand.
You need to either reduce prices of individual dishes OR increase quantities.
We had to order an extra chicken dish as well as an extra rice dish because of smaller quantities.

SERVICE:
The ONLY redeeming feature of this experience was the service - Your waiters did all they could to cater to us, including to try and fix the AC and even get rid of the fly with a racket. I did not gather the names of the staff members but they were all very nice and cooperative.

","To all my foodie friends out there living in Chennai or visiting Chennai India let me tell 
You one thing that's an absolute truth .

You want to enjoy a great authentic  South Indian in Chennai nothing can beat your home food served steaming hot...by your mother tender and loving care with me probably being the next best chef in my family .

Guess what the next best place in my view after eating out in many top restaurants around my City for years ,we have homed on to Okadey Sangeetha Resturant on  ,3rd Cross Rd, Govindaswamy Nagar, Raja Annamalai Puram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600028 when ever we decide not to cook at home and our Sunday breakfast for years 
Has been at this Okadeys .

Their meal whether it be breakfast lunch snack or a dinner is great served hot and 
Always leaves one with a great after taste. 
That in my view is a great compliment to an eatery. 

Its a Cozy and casual great vegetarian option next best to your home food served with great courtesy by very friendly staff headed by Mr Sridhar Manager ,who spends more time at this  restaurant ,than his home  and is still happily married .He knows most of their usual customers pretty well .

The food served here is very safe for kids and is a  good place for casual group meetings over breakfast especially  for morning fitness freaks with a cover of 120+ 

Although it's a multi cuisine resturant we honestly stick to South Indian breakfast and 
South Indian Thali. Jain food option is available on Sundays. It's open from 8 am to 11 pm on all days 

It also boasts of  a small hall to host a small  party .

All major credit cards are accepted and does have a parking facility for few cars .

Their prices are very reasonable for dining on comfort .

Try out this if you haven't and I am sure you will keep going there again and again.Its the positive energy of this place .!

We have always carried wonderful memories of awesome food served here besides its ambiance but...today was the most HORRIBLE experiance.

Tom Yum Soup was made with just few common vegetables into the Chicken Stock with no sign of any herbs and any flavor - totally bland. It seems a lot of turmeric powder waa douses into it. Worst ever.

We askwd to change the same to Sweet Corn Soup but that never came rather the Lunch was served in a hurry so that we could thrown out faster.

Our Lunch order was Stir Fried Vegetables, Chilli Chicken with semi-gravy, Chicken Hakka Noodles and Vegetable Fried Rice. The food served was just Warm not Hot, the Chilli Chicken came on the table after we were almost through with our lunch. The gravy of Stir Fried Vegetables and Chilli Chicken was almost the same. Wherein the Stir fried vegetables was not at all appealing.

All the food items were tasteless - bland. 

We just ate to fill our hunger but certainly spoilt our enthu to enjoy our Lunch at The Park.

The manager was helpless with only word of sorry and an excuse that their Chef has changed hence they have complaints. The earlier ones have retired and left.

It is very sad that we always had a very good experiance and memories for excellent food served here but now we lost this to a road side standard one.

We will certainly not go back to this place anymore and would not recommend anyone to waste their money and appetite.

The owners must realize that the good Chefs of any restaurant will bring in business or repeate business not anyone else.

Besides Anupa's service, the food was really good as well and I can certainly say that it lived up to my past experience. From the in house focaccia bread replete with the flavored butters to the espresso before the cheque,  everything was on point. The three stand out dishes were the quattro fromage pizza, the lamb  chops and the tiramisu.

The Russian salad was ok but served in a quarter plate, probably they had run out of the full plate.

Dal makhni was very average, you get better one in Dhabas
Now we talk about Laal Maans ...may be they are just fooling tourists by giving worst prepared dish in Rajasthan. Laal maans for them is lot of spices with base of Masalas.

The chicken in Malwani Murgh should be tender, moist, and well-marinated to ensure that the flavors permeate the meat. Look for well-cooked chicken pieces that are juicy and flavorful.

Chicken tikka is made by marinating chicken pieces...in a mixture of yogurt and spices, including ingredients like ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder. The marinated chicken is then traditionally cooked in a tandoor (clay oven) or grilled to perfection.
The chicken is usually cooked to perfection, tender and juicy, while the thick gravy adds a velvety and slightly chunky texture. The combination of soft chicken pieces and the thick, flavorful sauce provides a delightful mouthfeel.More",5.00

The place has a lot of vibe with excellent hospitality and delicious lip smacking Cuisines. They have a tinch of desi indian touch with their exotic masalas and flavourful...spices in their delicacies.
I had being here with my partner and enjoyed the live music, moody lights and what not.
I had tried-
In mocktails-
1. Thanda Teekha
An amazing conceptualized drink which is thanda when sipped but has a lot of after taste spiciness which is worth the try
2. Tanatan Sangria
The signature sangria with the perfect aroma and fruity touch
 
In starters-
3. Khow sey Samosa
A new face to the samosa served in small cups dipped in tomato and some masala salsa dip. Unique and tasty
4. Bharwa mirch Achaari Paneer tikka
The paneer cubes perfectly marinated with desi achaari and mirch sauces and cooked to perfection. The taste was wholesome and felt amazing.

Main course-
5. Firangi Nuska with Cheese garlic naan and butter roti
The best of the things that i tasted here and would highly recommend is this very special item. Exotic vegetables like bell peppers, zuchini, peas, babycorn and what not in a spiced cashew tomato gravy. This was really tempting

Desserts-
6. Gulkand cheese cake
Signature cheese cake topped with gulkand. Heavenly taste and satisfying.

Overall the experience was above amazing. The time spent here was really special with all the arrangements they had. Looking forward to visit again.

Firstly, we would like to say we have been to various barbecue outlets whether it's barbecue nation or castles barbecue. This outlet impressed us  with the variety that they have. Serving proteins such as emu, shark meat, uncultured bunny, duck, octopus. Having a...wide selection of cocktails and mocktails, as well as having a kids section where you can find McCain's and fries.
The best part about this barbecue is they have an ice cream counter where they make varietals as well as serving Mexican chilli ice cream.
We were impressed by the starters, but as soon as we arrived in main course and dessert, the taste and flavour wasn't upto the mark.
But for sure, you can try the proteins and enjoy their lip smacking cocktails.
But apart from the food, the very thing that we didn't like was the cleanliness of the restaurant, marks on the glass wall and the kind of crockery they used for soups and serving protein.
On Mondays & Tuesdays, dinner is served at 599 bucks whereas they serve lunch at the same price whole week.
Thank You!

I am...always in the learning phase of my life every single moment and at every single place. Blogging is passion and traveling to a different city every single day is giving me that content and experience to share it with all of you.

This time I was in Mumbai with clients having dinner at “B Kitchen” and here I am with another food blog about B kitchen food and experience I had in that Resturant. This place generally comes to the party after 10 pm so if you are visiting that place for a party make sure to visit after 10 pm. What I like most about this place is that cuisine from most part of the globe is available under one roof. This place is posh with a good crowd and spacious enough to not to feel suffocated. Open section with all the glass and dim lights looks amazing.

The Ambiance was amazing with proper and separate dining area, club area and Resturant area inside that also with good kind of crowd.

Music and Dj were good and loud as it’s normal for them but I believe Dj could play better and upgraded music but anyway it was fine.

Air Conditioning was so damn high and cool that we need to change our tables thrice just because of coolest AC temperature so any of you are a fan of minimum temperature should visit there once

Service was good and quick in terms of serving food and the staff was friendly too.

Services Available It would be better if I will explain you all in pointers to remember all the thing in order. I apologize if I am being a Teacher over here but I like things and human to be organized.

Food and Drinks I had In B Kitchen

Virgin Mojito was very balanced in terms of sweetness and sourness as generally, this Mojito seems great everywhere but here it was the perfect combination.

Watermelon Drink was good too with normal sweetener and cool enough that we don’t need an extra ice in it along with a slice of lemon on top of the glass.

Garlic Bread We had Garlic bread which I found can be better or you can say I tried better Garlic Bread Version in other places so you can skip Garlic Bread.

Truffle Flat Bread An actually really flat white colour bread with lots of mozzarellas cheese and some cherries over the top along with some green leaves which looks like Kari Patta not really sure what kind of green leaves over there maybe you can check from the pictures I had do let me know in comment section about this leaf.

Falafel – Well I did not like it much because maybe it’s not my taste it was not that bad though I liked the Sauce with this Falafel. and most people gave good reviews about this dish and by the way, it is my boss favorite dish so he always orders Falafel wherever he goes.

Lasagna- This was the most delicious dish I have ever eaten because I love lasagna a lot but B Kitchen Lasagna won over any lasagna funniestMore",5.00

Appam served fresh is the best part with the food. It’s an absolute luxury to get this....The starters were also delicious. Nethili fry we took couldn’t have been better. 
The gravies were not that fabulous though. We got the chettinad chicken which was a bit too watery. The mutton fry was better. I guess they could improve on overall taste with the gravies.More",5.00

Of all the food we...ordered, I highly recommend the Ulli Theeyal which is baby onions cooked in a spicy tamarind curry to go with soft Appams.
Semiya Payasam was to die for!! just the right amount of sweet, it was excellent.
The Idiyappam noodles were not as fine as in most places, so a bit of a letdown.
